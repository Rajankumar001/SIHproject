             It is tough for a pre-trial to be carried out smoothly especially when done in offline. Our web portal aims to solve this tedious problem. With the help of our web portal the pre-trial would be conducted efficiently. Our web portal is designed in such a way that it helps in submission of the cases as well as all the document related to it by both the litigants and executive side. It empowers the judges to easily access their respective cases and hold video conference for the same.
